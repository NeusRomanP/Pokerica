This project is based on Rothio Tome's *[Numerica Twitch](https://github.com/rothiotome/numerica-twitch)*

## How to play

This game consists of completing the Pokedex by listing the Pokemon in order. To do so, you mus type "!p " followed by the pokemon name. Example:

**!p Bulbasaur**

A player can give all the answers he wants in a row.

You can choose among three different levels:

- Easy: Next Pokemon name appears on screen.
- Mid: Three options appear on screen, one of them is the next Pokemon.
- Hard: No oprions appear on screen, you have to know the next Pokemon on the Pokedex.

You can also choose if the Pokedex restarts when a player fails or not.
